# acPCoA

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

AC-PCoA is a method proposed by Yu Wang etc., which reduces the data 
    dimension while extracting the information from different distance measures using  principal 
    coordinate analysis (PCoA), and adjusts the  confounding factors across multiple data sets  
    by minimizing  the  associations  between  the  lower  dimensional  representations and the 
    confounding variables. Application of the proposed method is further extended to  the 
    scenario of classification and prediction.

## Installation

To install the R package:
1. Download 'acPCA_1.0.tar.gz' in "/AC-PCA/R_package/";
2. In R/Rstudio, type install.packages("acPCA_1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

a
You can install the released version of acPCoA by downloading 'acPCA_version_number.tar.gz' in "YuWang/AC-PCA/R_package/" and typing:

``` r
install.packages("acPCA_version_number.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(acPCoA)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
